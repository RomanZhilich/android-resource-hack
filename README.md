android-resource-hack
====================

This is an example of how you can change string resource value at runtime, not that it's a good thing to do.
For now will only work with ant builds.<br/>
To run the example:<br/>
1) cd to project folder.<br/>
2) run "android update project -p ."<br/>
3) run "ant clean debug" to build debug apk.<br/>
4) run "ant installd" to install debug apk on device or emulator.

Disclaimer
==========

This is made just for fun, you should never implement this in real projects.
